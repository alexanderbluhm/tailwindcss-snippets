## Common Focus

Here is an example of the most easiest focus utilities you can use on `input`, `button` etc.

<button className="px-3 py-1.5 bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-300 to-red-500 rounded-md text-white focus:outline-none ring">
    Button
</button>

```html
<button class="**focus:outline-none focus:ring**">
    Button
</button>
```

You can also go creative by modifiying the `ring` parameters.

<button class="px-3 py-1.5 bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-400 to-sky-500 rounded-md text-white focus:outline-none ring-2 ring-offset-2 ring-emerald-400">
    Button
</button>

```html
<button class="focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 ring-offset-2 ring-emerald-400">
    Button
</button>
```
