Here is an example of the most easiest focus utilities you can use on `input`, `button` etc.

<button class="px-3 py-1.5 bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-300 to-red-500 rounded-md text-white shadow-sm focus:outline-none focus:ring">
    Button
</button>

```html
<button class="**focus:outline-none focus:ring**">
    Button
</button>
```
